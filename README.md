This is simple multiplayer mini-game with a single shared world map.
This project has been made during 3 days right before the date 01.01.2022.

Controls: WASD (movement) + H (hint at the location of a closest present).

Win condition: all presents and found Christmas Wreath and then picked up the ladder.

The map will be automatically reset after some time past since winning the game.

For the mobile players the character will walk/run towards the closest non-mobile player automatically (max range is 15 "tiles").
